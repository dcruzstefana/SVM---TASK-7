# SVM---TASK-7
SVM
This project demonstrates the implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification using a real-world breast cancer dataset. The dataset is preprocessed by encoding categorical labels and normalizing features to ensure effective model training. Two SVM classifiers are trained: one using a linear kernel and the other with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, to handle both linearly and non-linearly separable data. To enhance interpretability, dimensionality reduction is applied using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), allowing the decision boundaries of both models to be visualized in two dimensions. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the performance of the RBF kernel by exploring different values of the regularization parameter C and kernel coefficient gamma. The model is further evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure generalization, and its accuracy is assessed on a test set. Finally, the results are presented using a confusion matrix heatmap, providing a clear overview of the model's classification performance.
